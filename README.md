In this project we tested four different models on the provided weather and satellite data. We used a Linear Regression Model, a Multi-Layer Perceptron, a Convolutional Neural Network and a Long-Short Term Memory model. <br>
The LSTM is our best performing model: <br>
It uses shuffled data without locations and without any rigorous optimization techniques.

The data folder contains the raw and cleaned data for our project.

The data preparation folder contains the scripts we have used for data exploration and preprocessing.

The meetings folder contains notes we made during our meetings.

The model folder will eventually contain our model.

The report folder will eventually contain our final report. 
The final report will be written in LaTeX using overleaf, which can be found here:
