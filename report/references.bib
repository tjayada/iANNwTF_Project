	abstract = {Abstract. We applied a multiple linear regression model to understand the relationships of PM2.5 with meteorological variables in the contiguous US and from there to infer the sensitivity of PM2.5 to climate change. We used 2004–2008 PM2.5 observations from {\textasciitilde}1000 sites ({\textasciitilde}200 sites for PM2.5 components) and compared to results from the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM). All data were deseasonalized to focus on synoptic-scale correlations. We find strong positive correlations of PM2.5 components with temperature in most of the US, except for nitrate in the Southeast where the correlation is negative. Relative humidity (RH) is generally positively correlated with sulfate and nitrate but negatively correlated with organic carbon. GEOS-Chem results indicate that most of the correlations of PM2.5 with temperature and RH do not arise from direct dependence but from covariation with synoptic transport. We applied principal component analysis and regression to identify the dominant meteorological modes controlling PM2.5 variability, and show that 20–40\% of the observed PM2.5 day-to-day variability can be explained by a single dominant meteorological mode: cold frontal passages in the eastern US and maritime inflow in the West. These and other synoptic transport modes drive most of the overall correlations of PM2.5 with temperature and RH except in the Southeast. We show that interannual variability of PM2.5 in the US Midwest is strongly correlated with cyclone frequency as diagnosed from a spectral-autoregressive analysis of the dominant meteorological mode. An ensemble of five realizations of 1996–2050 climate change with the GISS general circulation model (GCM) using the same climate forcings shows inconsistent trends in cyclone frequency over the Midwest (including in sign), with a likely decrease in cyclone frequency implying an increase in PM2.5. Our results demonstrate the need for multiple GCM realizations (because of climate chaos) when diagnosing the effect of climate change on PM2.5, and suggest that analysis of meteorological modes of variability provides a computationally more affordable approach for this purpose than coupled GCM-CTM studies.},

	abstract = {The detection and treatment of increasing air pollution due to technological developments represent some of the most important challenges facing the world today. Indeed, there has been a significant increase in levels of environmental pollution in recent years. The aim of the work presented herein is to design an intelligent predictor for the concentrations of air pollutants over the next 2 days based on deep learning techniques using a recurrent neural network (RNN). The best structure for its operation is then determined using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The new predictor based on intelligent computation relying on unsupervised learning, i.e., long short-term memory (LSTM) and optimization (i.e., PSO), is called the smart air quality prediction model (SAQPM). The main goal is to predict six the concentrations of six types of air pollution, viz. PM2.5 particulate matter, PM10, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). SAQPM consists of four stages. The first stage involves data collection from multiple stations (35 in this case). The second stage involves preprocessing of the data, including (a) separation of each station with an independent focus, (b) handle missing values, and (c) normalization of the dataset to the range of (0, 1) using the MinMaxScalar method. The third stage relates to building the predictor based on the LSTM method by identifying the best structure and parameter values (weight, bias, number of hidden layers, number of nodes in each hidden layer, and activation function) for the network using the functional PSO algorithm to achieve a goal. Thereafter, the dataset is split into training and testing parts based on the ten cross-validation principle. The training dataset is then used to build the predictor. In the fourth stage, evaluation results for each station are obtained by reading the concentration of each pollutant each hour for at most 30 days then taking the average of the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) for 25 days only.},

	abstract = {Fine particulate matter (\$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{PM\}\_\{2.5\}\$\$) has a considerable impact on human health, the environment and climate change. It is estimated that with better predictions, US\$9 billion can be saved over a 10-year period in the USA (State of the science fact sheet air quality. http://www.noaa.gov/factsheets/new, 2012). Therefore, it is crucial to keep developing models and systems that can accurately predict the concentration of major air pollutants. In this paper, our target is to predict \$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{PM\}\_\{2.5\}\$\$concentration in Japan using environmental monitoring data obtained from physical sensors with improved accuracy over the currently employed prediction models. To do so, we propose a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) that is enhanced with a novel pre-training method using auto-encoder especially designed for time series prediction. Additionally, sensors selection is performed within DRNN without harming the accuracy of the predictions by taking advantage of the sparsity found in the network. The numerical experiments show that DRNN with our proposed pre-training method is superior than when using a canonical and a state-of-the-art auto-encoder training method when applied to time series prediction. The experiments confirm that when compared against the \$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{PM\}\_\{2.5\}\$\$prediction system VENUS (National Institute for Environmental Studies. Visual Atmospheric Environment Utility System. http://envgis5.nies.go.jp/osenyosoku/, 2014), our technique improves the accuracy of \$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{PM\}\_\{2.5\}\$\$concentration level predictions that are being reported in Japan.},

	abstract = {Air pollution is a serious environmental problem that has drawn worldwide attention. Predicting air pollution in advance has great significance on people's daily health control and government decision-making. However, existing research methods have failed to effectively extract the spatiotemporal features of air pollutant concentration data, and exhibited low precision in long-term predictions and sudden changes in air quality. In the present study, a spatiotemporal convolutional long short-term memory neural network extended (C-LSTME) model for predicting air quality concentration was proposed. In order to encompass the spatiality and temporality of the data, the model involved the historical air pollutant concentration of the present station, as well as that of the adaptive k-nearest neighboring stations, into the model. High-level spatiotemporal features were extracted through the combination of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM-NN), and meteorological data and aerosol data were also integrated, in order to improve model prediction performance. Hourly PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 mm) concentration data collected at 1233 air quality monitoring stations in Beijing and the whole China from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017 were used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed C-LSTME model. The results show that the present model has achieved better performance than current state-of-the-art models for different time predictions at different regional scales.},

The model applies interpolation to air quality and weather data and then uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict PM concentrations. The interpolation transforms the irregular spatial data into an equally spaced grid, which the model requires. This combination creates the interpolated CNN (ICNN) model that we use to predict PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations. The PM10 and PM2.5 evaluation results show an effective prediction performance with an R-squared higher than 0.97 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of approximately 16\% of the standard deviation. Furthermore, both PM10 and PM2.5 prediction models forecast high concentrations with high reliability, with a probability of detection higher than 0.90 and a critical success index exceeding 0.85. The proposed ICNN prediction model achieves a high prediction performance using spatio-temporal information and presents a new direction in the prediction field.},
