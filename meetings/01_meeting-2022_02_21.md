Meeting with Charlie

- what project to pursue ?
- what is manageable ?

- our ideas were:
	1. Nasa Airathon
	2. Zindi Air Polution
	3. Walk of Penguins
	4. Sea Turtle face detection

- Nasa Airathon to complex
- Sea Turtle project already done by two groups
- Penguins might be difficult in data cleaning 
- Air Solution probably easier since data is already clean

We need to make a decision between Air Pollution and Penguins till next week

-> Next meeting with Charlie is planned to be on Monday the 28th of february


Also talked about the project report loosely
