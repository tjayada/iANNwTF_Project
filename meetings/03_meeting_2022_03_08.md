we have met as a small kick off meeting in person and Johannes was taking part online. 

- talked about what we have found out so far
- talked about the data structure and features
- what model seems plausible, decided for LSTM
- how our data should look like, so we want to include weekdays, weekend, holidays based on the dates the data provides
- gave everyone a task to complete for the next meeting on the 10th of march
- Johannes will explain the data for our report
- Konstantin will look into existing studies and reports in regard to the LSTM we want to build
- Tjark will clean the data and will try to implement the ideas with the weekdays etc. from the data
