second meeting with Charlie

talked about the two projects again and decided on the Penguin Project.


Later our group met again to discuss how we want to proceed.

Looked at Penguin Project throughly and were not able to download the data for the competition, since it already closed.

Decided to do the Air pollution project

- decided to have a look at the data and the documentation and to get a feel for the project.

- decided to individually work on project for one week and then meet again in person on tuesday the 8th of march to work on the project together and discuss problems and solutions that we have encountered.

Things To Do:
