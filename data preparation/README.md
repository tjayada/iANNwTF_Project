This folder contains the scripts we are using for cleaning and shaping the data in the way we need it.

These scripts are in chronological order and start with 01 as our first impressions and end in 05 with two scripts creating two different data sets and 06 with creating a special data set for the LSTM. 

05_finished_and_clean(1) contains the script for creating the data set without the columns that mainly consisted of missing data.

05_finished_and_clean(2) contains the script for creating the data set where all missing data is replaced by the mean values of the respective columns. 

06_finished_and_clean_LSTM(1) contains the special script for the LSTM in which the data set without the columns that mainly consisted of missing data also contains encoded information about the different locations.
