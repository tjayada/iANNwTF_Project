This folder contains the scripts we are using for cleaning and shaping the data in the way we need it.

These scripts are in chronological order and start with 01 as our first impressions and end in 05 with two scripts creating two different data sets. 

05_finished_and_clean(1) contains the script for creating the data set without the columns that mainly consisted of missing data.

05_finished_and_clean(2) contains the script for creating the data set where all missing data is replaced by the mean values of the respective columns.
