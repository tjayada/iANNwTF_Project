The raw data folder contains the raw data we got from the competition at https://zindi.africa/competitions/zindiweekendz-learning-urban-air-pollution-challenge

The cleaned data (1) folder contains the data we have obtained after removing columns that mainly consisted of missing data.

The cleaned data (2) folder contains the data we have obtained by filling the missing data with the mean values of the respective columns.

Both cleaned data (1) and (2) are usable and it is merely a matter of opinion. Maybe we will find out that one set is better for our task at hand than the other one is.
